I'm a final year Psychology student in the University of Hong Kong.
As I do not have a CS background, I develop my programming skill through self-learning. I'm learning:
- python
- R
- Matlab

I'm planning to do a master degree in Data Science in the future because I enjoy the processes of finding insights from data.
To further develop and train my skills, I'm currently looking for entry positions with the opportunity to pre-process or analyze data.
